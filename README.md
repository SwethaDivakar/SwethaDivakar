Hello,
I am currently on a journey of self discovery - I am trying to identify the area where I shine!
I am working on stuff that has always intimidated me - Math and Programming.
When I was a computer science undergrad, I wasn't as serious and even though I was strong in my concepts and good with programming, I negleted being prepared and that made me loose out on a lot of oppurtunities. While I got a great start in my carrer, I am left wondering about the missed ones.
I am now working on the skills that I know I have but did not work on for the fear of it being too difficult.
I am working towards a PhD and this will be my portfolio.
I have a lot of interests and a very diverse profile to which I am trying to bring some depth.
Thank you for staying with me till now!
Drop a mail to let me know you are here or if you find something interesting on here.
Swetha Divakar
